This poster is my heartfelt representation of the harsh reality of child labour.


At the center, you see children burdened with work—carrying utensils, washing dishes, doing tasks far beyond their age. These children should be in schools, playing, learning, and dreaming. But instead, they’re stuck in a cycle of labour and lost childhood.

Behind them, I’ve painted the faded outline of a child—symbolizing the innocence, education, and joy that are slowly fading away. The ABCs and books in the background represent what they deserve: education, not exploitation.

This poster is the result of a great team effort. The concept and thought behind it were driven by Manjeet, with the sketch by Buddy. Each corner of the design was carefully focused on, and the vibrant colors were brought to life by Sachin, Yogesh, and myself.

The message is simple but powerful—“Stop Child Labour.”
This poster is a reminder that every child deserves a future filled with possibilities, not pain. Let’s raise our voices, create awareness, and be part of the change to ensure every child is free to learn, play, and grow.
