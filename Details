Here’s your revised 90-second winning script, clearly structured, engaging, and including the explicit transition statement at the end for handing over to Akshay:

⸻

[Start with energy and urgency (0–20 secs)]
“Did you know that cybersecurity breaches cost financial institutions globally over 5 trillion pounds annually? Recent breaches, such as the MOVEit cyberattack, significantly impacted banks—leading to massive financial losses and intense regulatory scrutiny. Clearly, proactive risk management has never been more critical.”

⸻

[Explain the problem clearly and personally (20–50 secs)]
“When we analyzed our internal data from the past two years, we uncovered a striking insight: we’ve had approximately 250 cybersecurity-related issues, resulting in financial impacts of nearly 1.45 billion GBP. On digging deeper, we found the root cause: our current cybersecurity control assurance processes heavily rely on manual or semi-automated checks. This periodic approach is resource-intensive, error-prone, and most importantly, lacks real-time detection—leaving Barclays vulnerable to threats.”

⸻

[Clearly state your objective (50–70 secs)]
“Our objective is clear: transform cybersecurity control assurance at Barclays from reactive and manual, to proactive and intelligence-driven, powered by Generative AI.”

⸻

[Transition to Akshay (explicit handover)]
“To take you through how Generative AI can revolutionize our approach and the tangible benefits it will bring to Barclays, I’ll now hand it over to Akshay.”

⸻

Delivery Tone and Tips:
	•	Maintain an engaging, conversational pace.
	•	Pause briefly after each critical statistic for emphasis.
