Here's a script to present the "Repeat Issue Analysis" slide, tailored for a stakeholder meeting:

---

### Introducing the Topic: Repeat Issue Analysis

**You:**  
"Next, let’s dive into the topic of 'Repeat Issue Analysis,' which is an important part of ensuring that similar issues don’t keep recurring over time within our organization. This analysis helps identify issues that appear repeatedly within different parts of the business, specifically looking at the vertical and horizontal combinations based on their issue descriptions."

---

### Explaining "What" (What is Repeat Issue Analysis?)

**You:**  
"To start with, the 'What' section outlines the purpose of this analysis. Our goal is to develop a solution that identifies repeat issues, by analyzing the issue descriptions across both vertical and horizontal combinations. 

One important note is that when we refer to 'repetition,' we mean issues that share similar descriptions but occur at different times. These issues can span across various horizontals and verticals, making it essential to address them to prevent further occurrences."

---

### Explaining "Why" (Why is this Important?)

**You:**  
"Now, moving to the 'Why' section: Repeat issues often indicate deeper, more intrinsic problems that need attention. If we don’t address these issues properly, they can keep cropping up, leading to inefficiencies and potentially larger problems. By identifying these repeat issues, we can take more focused actions to prevent them from recurring, which ultimately improves our processes."

---

### Explaining "How" (How is this Done?)

**You:**  
"So, how are we going about identifying these repeat issues? We are leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Data Analytics techniques. These advanced technologies allow us to analyze the issue descriptions systematically and recognize patterns across different cases. This way, we can identify similarities and repetitions that might not be obvious at first glance."

---

### Explaining "For Whom" (Who Benefits from This?)

**You:**  
"This analysis is specifically being applied for BUK, though we plan to expand it further. However, it's important to note that identifying and addressing repeat issues has broader benefits for the organization as a whole, ensuring efficiency and reducing risks of ongoing problems."

---

### Explaining "Benefits/Results" (What Results Have We Seen?)

**You:**  
"Looking at the 'Benefits/Results' section, we’ve analyzed data from January 2021 to June 2023, and the results are quite interesting. About 45% of the total issues in this period were considered, and we found that approximately 5% of the issues had the potential to be repeated. Additionally, around 17% of these issues were potentially repeated across organizations, highlighting the importance of this analysis in identifying and mitigating such risks."

---

### Explaining "Next Steps"

**You:**  
"Finally, the 'Next Steps' section shows that we’re planning to replicate this analysis across other verticals and horizontals. By scaling up, we can ensure that all parts of the business benefit from this process, ultimately minimizing the risk of recurring issues."

---

**You:**  
"So, in summary, Repeat Issue Analysis helps us identify patterns in recurring issues, enabling us to address the root causes more effectively. This will lead to more efficient processes, reduced risk, and overall improved organizational performance. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask."
