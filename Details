Perfect — thanks for laying this out so clearly. You basically have a supervised learning problem: multiclass text classification (Complaint vs Concern vs Query) using call transcripts + supporting features (sentiment score, cost, etc.). Let me walk you through how I’d design it:

⸻

1. Frame the Problem
	•	Inputs: Call transcripts (text), customer sentiment score (-5 to +5), financial impact (numeric), possibly metadata like call duration if available.
	•	Output Labels: Complaint, Concern, Query.
	•	Type of Task: Supervised multiclass classification (with some imbalance likely, since not all calls escalate).

⸻

2. Data Preparation
	1.	Text Cleaning
	•	Remove boilerplate agent phrases like “Welcome to Barclays”, “Let me verify your credentials”.
	•	Normalize punctuation, lowercase, remove filler words like “uh”, “hmm”.
	•	Consider speaker separation (Agent vs Customer) — you may find that customer utterances carry most of the signal.
	2.	Label Assignment
	•	You already have “complaint” vs “concern” tags.
	•	For queries, you’ll likely have to backfill/null-tagged calls with heuristics:
	•	No dissatisfaction keywords + neutral/positive sentiment = Query.
	•	Or, you can manually label a seed set of nulls to bootstrap a Query class.
	3.	Feature Engineering
	•	From Text: embeddings from models like BERT, RoBERTa, or domain fine-tuned FinBERT.
	•	From Structured Data:
	•	Sentiment score → strong signal (negative sentiment correlates with complaints).
	•	Financial impact → high > complaint; low/zero > likely concern/query.
	•	Combine both (early fusion: concat embeddings + features into classifier).

⸻

3. Model Approaches
	•	Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression or SVM (good for explainability, quick benchmark).
	•	Next Step: Fine-tuned transformer (DistilBERT, FinBERT, or domain-adapted model) on your transcripts.
	•	Hybrid:
	1.	Transformer encodes text → dense embedding.
	2.	Append sentiment score + financial impact.
	3.	Feed into a classifier head (dense layers → softmax).

4. Handling Definitions

Your definitions of complaint vs concern vs query map nicely to keywords + features:
	•	Complaint:
	•	Language: “raise complaint”, “file a complaint”, “compensation”, “loss”, “refund”.
	•	Features: negative sentiment, non-zero cost.
	•	Concern:
	•	Language: “issue”, “problem”, “not working”, but softer tone.
	•	Features: mild negative sentiment, low/zero financial cost, resolved by explanation.
	•	Query:
	•	Language: “how do I…?”, “can you tell me…?”, “what is…?”.
	•	Features: neutral/positive sentiment, no dissatisfaction terms.

👉 You can seed weak labels using regex/keyword rules + sentiment thresholds, then refine via ML. This is powerful if you don’t have huge labeled data yet.

⸻

5. Evaluation Strategy
	•	Use F1-score per class (since imbalances will matter).
	•	Pay attention to Complaint recall (regulatory risk if you miss them).
	•	Use Confusion Matrix to see if model often mixes Concern vs Complaint — common pain point.

⸻

6. Explainability

Since this is in risk/compliance assurance, explainability matters. Options:
	•	Use SHAP or LIME to show which words/features influenced prediction.
	•	Maintain keyword-based fallback rules for edge cases (especially for regulatory reporting).

⸻

7. Deployment Flow
	1.	Ingest call transcript from AWS Contact Lens.
	2.	Preprocess text → transformer embedding.
	3.	Combine with sentiment + cost.
	4.	ML model → predict {Complaint, Concern, Query}.
	5.	Route:
	•	Complaint → special queue (regulatory).
	•	Concern → normal service resolution.
	•	Query → FAQ/first-level support.

⚡ So, with your current dataset, you’re in an excellent position: you already have labels, transcripts, sentiment, and cost impact. That’s basically a full supervised training set.

⸻

Do you want me to draft a prototype pipeline in Python (pseudocode or actual code) that shows how you’d train such a classifier (text embeddings + sentiment + cost → multiclass prediction)?
