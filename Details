Nice — here’s a concise, non-fluffy walk-through you can use with confidence: what the Python script does, why each derived column exists, how the Excel pivots are built from those columns, and exactly how to present the results to management.

Python: what it does and why (step-by-step)

Here’s a production-ready, efficient version of the Python flow. After that I’ll explain each block and the assumptions.

import pandas as pd

# ---------- CONFIG ----------
INPUT_FILE = "risk_data.xlsx"
OUTPUT_FILE = "risk_data_with_derived.xlsx"
CLOSE_PREFIX = "Closed"   # we'll treat anything that startswith "Closed" as closed

# ---------- LOAD & PARSE ----------
df = pd.read_excel(INPUT_FILE)
date_cols = ["Event Occurrence Date", "Action Due Date", "Action Start Date", "Action Closed Date"]
for c in date_cols:
    if c in df.columns:
        df[c] = pd.to_datetime(df[c], errors="coerce")

# ---------- DUE MONTH ----------
# YYYY-MM for grouping; blank if no due date
df["Due Month"] = df.get("Action Due Date").dt.to_period("M").astype(str)
df.loc[df["Action Due Date"].isna(), "Due Month"] = ""

# ---------- ACTION CLOSURE STATUS ----------
def closure_status(row):
    status = str(row.get("Action Status",""))
    if status.startswith(CLOSE_PREFIX):
        if pd.notna(row.get("Action Due Date")):
            if pd.notna(row.get("Action Closed Date")) and row["Action Closed Date"] <= row["Action Due Date"]:
                return "Closed On Time"
            else:
                return "Closed Late"
        else:
            return "Closed (No Due Date)"
    else:
        return "Open"
df["Action Closure Status"] = df.apply(closure_status, axis=1)

# ---------- RISK-MONTH LEVEL: fully remediated or not ----------
# produce one row per (Due Month, Risk Event ID) with counts
has_action_id = "Action ID" in df.columns and not df["Action ID"].isna().all()

if has_action_id:
    agg_total = ("Action ID", "nunique")
else:
    agg_total = ("Action Status", "size")

risk_month = (
    df[df["Due Month"] != ""]
    .groupby(["Due Month", "Risk Event ID"])
    .agg(
        total_actions = agg_total,
        closed_actions = ("Action Status", lambda x: sum(str(s).startswith(CLOSE_PREFIX) for s in x.astype(str)))
    )
    .reset_index()
)

risk_month["Fully_Remediated"] = (risk_month["total_actions"] == risk_month["closed_actions"])
risk_month["IsFullyRemediated"] = risk_month["Fully_Remediated"].astype(int)

# ---------- MONTHLY SUMMARY ----------
monthly_stats = (
    risk_month.groupby("Due Month")
    .agg(
        total_risks = ("Risk Event ID", "nunique"),
        remediated_risks = ("IsFullyRemediated", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
)
monthly_stats["Pct_Remediated"] = monthly_stats["remediated_risks"] / monthly_stats["total_risks"]

# ---------- MERGE BACK (optional but useful for pivoting) ----------
# join IsFullyRemediated back to the row-level data so every row has the risk-month flag
df = df.merge(
    risk_month[["Due Month","Risk Event ID","IsFullyRemediated","Fully_Remediated"]],
    on=["Due Month","Risk Event ID"],
    how="left"
)
df["IsFullyRemediated"] = df["IsFullyRemediated"].fillna(0).astype(int)

# ---------- EXPORT ----------
with pd.ExcelWriter(OUTPUT_FILE, engine="openpyxl") as w:
    df.to_excel(w, sheet_name="Processed_Rows", index=False)
    risk_month.to_excel(w, sheet_name="RiskMonthSummary", index=False)
    monthly_stats.to_excel(w, sheet_name="MonthlySummary", index=False)

print("Done. Output saved to", OUTPUT_FILE)

What each block does (plain English)
	•	Load & parse: reads your Excel and coerces date columns into real dates. Invalid / blank dates become NaT.
	•	Due Month: creates Due Month = "YYYY-MM" from Action Due Date. If Action Due Date is blank, Due Month is blank. This is the month-bucket we use for “remediation this month”.
	•	Action Closure Status: a readable label per action:
	•	Closed On Time (closed and closed_date ≤ due_date)
	•	Closed Late
	•	Closed (No Due Date)
	•	Open
This helps pivot counts by on-time vs late vs open.
	•	Risk-Month aggregation: for each (Due Month, Risk Event ID) we:
	•	count the total actions (unique Action IDs if present; otherwise rows),
	•	count closed actions (anything starting with "Closed"),
	•	set Fully_Remediated = True only if all actions in that risk-month are closed.
	•	expose IsFullyRemediated as 1/0 (useful for averaging in Pivot).
	•	Monthly summary: for each Due Month we compute:
	•	total_risks (number of distinct risk IDs with actions due that month)
	•	remediated_risks (how many of those risk-months were fully remediated)
	•	Pct_Remediated = remediated_risks / total_risks (decimal fraction)
	•	Merge back: attach the IsFullyRemediated flag back to each original row — convenient for building pivots directly from the full table.
	•	Export: writes three sheets:
	•	Processed_Rows (row-level, derived columns added)
	•	RiskMonthSummary (one row per risk-month)
	•	MonthlySummary (clean one-row-per-month summary with %)

Important assumptions & edge cases
	•	The code treats any status that starts with "Closed" as closed. That handles Closed- Actions completed and similar variants. You can change CLOSE_PREFIX if needed.
	•	Rows with no Action Due Date are excluded from the “Due Month” bucket (they get Due Month = ""). They do not contribute to monthly % remediated unless you decide to map them differently.
	•	For total_actions, the code uses Action ID distinct count if available; otherwise it counts rows.
	•	If Action Closed Date is blank for a row marked closed, it will be treated as Closed Late unless no due date exists (then Closed (No Due Date)).
	•	The risk-month definition ties remediations to the month of the Action Due Date (per your ask). If you want to measure closure by the month when the risk was closed, we can change to use Action Closed Date or a vintage matrix.

Excel: pivots to build from the exported file

You now have Processed_Rows, RiskMonthSummary, and MonthlySummary. Use whichever is easiest for the report. I’ll give concrete pivot builds you can create quickly.

Prep (recommended)
	1.	Open risk_data_with_derived.xlsx.
	2.	Convert Processed_Rows into an Excel Table (select data → Insert → Table). Name it tblProcessed.
	3.	When you create pivot(s), check Add this data to the Data Model — that enables Distinct Count if you want it.

⸻

Pivot A — % Fully Remediated per Month (recommended)

Data: use tblProcessed (has IsFullyRemediated), or use MonthlySummary for a straight table.

If using tblProcessed:
	•	Insert → PivotTable (from Table/Range, add to Data Model).
	•	Rows → Due Month
	•	Values →
	•	IsFullyRemediated → Value Field Settings → Average → Format as Percentage (this gives % of risk-months fully remediated)
	•	Risk Event ID → Value Field Settings → Distinct Count (shows total risk count in month)

If using MonthlySummary (no pivot needed):
	•	The Pct_Remediated column is already ready. You can create a simple chart from it.

⸻

Pivot B — Action Closure Distribution (On-time / Late / Open)

Data: tblProcessed
	•	Rows → Due Month
	•	Columns → Action Closure Status
	•	Values → Action ID (Count) or Action ID Distinct Count if you need unique actions
	•	This shows monthly counts of On Time vs Late vs Open actions.

⸻

Pivot C — Risk Volume Trend (risks raised per occurrence month)

Data: Processed_Rows
	•	Rows → Event Occurrence Date (group by Month)
	•	Values → Risk Event ID → Distinct Count
	•	This shows new risks raised by month.

⸻

Pivot D — Fully Remediated tracking (Yes/No)

Data: RiskMonthSummary or tblProcessed if easier
	•	Rows → Due Month
	•	Columns → Fully_Remediated (True/False or Yes/No)
	•	Values → Risk Event ID → Distinct Count
	•	Add calculated % if you prefer, or use IsFullyRemediated average approach.

⸻

Chart idea (management-friendly)

Build a combo chart:
	•	Bars = Total risks (per month) (from Distinct Count)
	•	Line = % Fully Remediated (Average of IsFullyRemediated)
	•	Put the % line on secondary axis, format clearly, add a benchmark line (e.g., target 90% remediation)

Insert → PivotChart or create chart from MonthlySummary.

How to explain this to management — what to say

Here’s a short script + bullet points to accompany charts.

Slide / headline:
“Remediation performance (Due-month basis): X% of risks with actions due in Jul-2025 were fully remediated on time.”

Explain metric (one sentence):
“Fully remediated = every action tied to the risk for that due-month was closed. We measure per risk-month because actions can span months; this tells us if the risk was cleaned up within the month it was due.”

What the chart shows:
	•	Trend line = % of risk-months that were fully remediated on time.
	•	Bars = number of risk-months in that period (volume).
	•	Use the combo view to explain whether increasing volume is driving any drop in remediation %.

Top talking points to show:
	•	Current month % and change vs previous month (delta).
	•	3-month trend (improving/worsening).
	•	Top 5 risk events not remediated (with financial impact & days open).
	•	Root causes: missing due dates, resource bottlenecks, high complexity actions.
	•	Recommended actions: assign owners, tighten SLAs, complete missing due dates.

Caveats to call out (be explicit):
	•	Rows with blank Action Due Date are excluded from the monthly % (they appear as Due Month = ""). We should decide whether these should be assigned to a month.
	•	Our definition of “Closed” accepts any status starting with “Closed”. If your process introduces new closed statuses, it’ll still match.
	•	A risk raised in Jan whose actions become due in May will not count in Jan’s % — this is by design (we measure remediation relative to when actions were due).

Practical tips / next steps
	•	If you want to count risks by the month they were closed instead of due, we can easily produce a vintage matrix (Raised Month vs Closed Month).
	•	If some Action Due Date are missing, ask the source team to backfill — that materially improves accuracy.
	•	If your workbook will be refreshed monthly, make the Python step a one-click script (or use an automated ETL job) so the three sheets are always ready.
	•	Add Slicers to the pivot for Escalation Rating and Workflow Status so execs can filter to high-severity risks.

⸻

If you want, I’ll:
	•	produce the exact Excel pivot layout screenshots (I can produce the step-by-step text),
	•	or adapt the script to treat blank due-dates differently (e.g., map to Action Closed Date month),
	•	or give the exact text for 3 slides you can drop into PowerPoint.

Which one should I do next?
