I have no concerns with Upasana — she’s a strong people leader who genuinely listens, offers valuable guidance, and supports our professional growth, especially in how we approach projects. The speak-up culture is well-established, and overall, the environment is positive.

However, the key challenge we’re currently facing is on the infrastructure front. We’re constrained by the models and tools currently available to us, which limits our ability to scale or innovate beyond what’s already in place.

Recently, we participated in a hackathon where we got exposure to advanced tools and capabilities already being leveraged within Barclays. As a team, we’re keen to explore similar opportunities that would allow us to bring more advanced AI-driven assurance practices into our book of work.
