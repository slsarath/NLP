I’ll walk you through the results of our analysis on the quality of risk events based on a defined set of criteria.

1. Narrative Quality Assessment:
The first part of our analysis focused on assessing the quality of the narratives. We evaluated them against the following key criteria:
	•	Word Count Threshold: Ensuring that narratives meet the required length to provide adequate detail.
	•	Acronym Extraction: Identifying acronyms and mapping them to their full forms to improve clarity and standardization.

This ensures that narratives are comprehensive, detailed, and easily understandable, especially when reviewed by stakeholders or external auditors.

2. Financial Value Patterns:
The second part of our analysis focused on identifying patterns related to financial values.
	•	We extracted patterns such as amounts reflecting financial values within the narratives.
	•	These extracted patterns were then matched with the financial impact value to verify alignment and consistency.

This step helps ensure that financial details provided in the narratives accurately reflect the actual impact, reducing the risk of discrepancies.

3. PII Extraction:
In addition to narrative and financial analysis, we also conducted PII (Personally Identifiable Information) extraction.
	•	This includes identifying sensitive information such as email addresses, account numbers, sort codes, customer names, and other PII elements.

This step is critical for compliance and ensures that any sensitive data is flagged and handled appropriately as per regulatory standards.

Closing and Next Steps:
In summary, our analysis provides a comprehensive review of narrative quality, financial value consistency, and PII compliance. This ensures that risk events are documented accurately and meet the expected quality standards.

If there are any specific areas you’d like us to delve deeper into or if you have any feedback, we’d be happy to incorporate that into our next steps.

Thank you, and I’m happy to answer any questions or discuss this further.
