That’s a common first-time GitLab setup step — let me walk you through how to generate and add an SSH key, so you can securely push and pull code from GitLab.

✅ STEP-BY-STEP: Add Your SSH Key to GitLab

⸻

🛠️ Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if you don’t have one already)

Open your terminal and run:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

	•	When prompted for a file path, press Enter to accept the default (~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
	•	When prompted for a passphrase, you can press Enter (optional)

This creates two files:
	•	~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (private key)
	•	~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (public key)

⸻

📝 Step 2: Copy the Public Key

Run the command below to copy your public key to clipboard:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the entire output (starts with ssh-ed25519…).

🌐 Step 3: Add SSH Key to GitLab
	1.	Go to GitLab SSH Keys
	2.	In the “Key” field, paste the key you copied
	3.	Give it a Title (like “Laptop SSH Key”)
	4.	Click Add key

⸻

🔁 Step 4: Test the SSH Connection

Run:

ssh -T git@gitlab.com

Expected output:

Welcome to GitLab, @your-username!


⸻

🔄 Step 5: Update Git Remote URL (Optional)

If you cloned the repo via HTTPS but now want to use SSH, run:

git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git


⸻

You’re now all set to push and pull via SSH 🎉

Once done, let me know — I’ll walk you through the app.py, .gitlab-ci.yml, and deployment next.
