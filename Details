For the games round, Iâ€™ll kick things off with a warm-up game, followed by Asaâ€™s game, which promises to be even more exciting to play! ðŸ˜Š

Game: Guess the Country
Iâ€™ll display a series of emoticons, and youâ€™ll need to guess the country name by typing your answer in the Teams chat. Please note that only typed answers will be countedâ€”no verbal responses!
