Hi Mark,
All good on my end—thank you! I hope you’re doing well too.

Yes, we can definitely proceed with this. I’ll arrange a meeting next week to discuss the requirements in detail.
Please let me know if that works for you.


In the meantime, could you please share a brief note over email outlining the value addition the current automation tool has brought to your process? This will help me provide an update to my management and support my request for additional capacity to scale the tool, considering our current book of work.
