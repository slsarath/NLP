Hi Tanja,

Thank you for your note.

As the filter criteria need to be applied on ORAC, we are expecting the input file to be provided by your team. Please note that this test population was not included as part of the current PROC mapping testing.

The automation script is designed to process data starting from row 9 onwards.

That said, we’d be happy to rerun the script once we receive all the required input files from your end.

Additionally, please do let us know if you’re satisfied with the results of the PRO mapping shared so far.

Feel free to reach out in case of any questions—happy to connect over a call if needed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
