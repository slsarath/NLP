To combine two columns that contain lists in Excel, you can use the following approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Convert Text to Lists
If your lists are stored as text strings (e.g., `['a']`), you first need to ensure that Excel recognizes them as separate items. Excel does not inherently support list data types, so we treat them as text and manipulate them.

### Step 2: Use Excel Formulas to Combine Lists
Assuming you have the following in your cells:
- **A1**: `['a']`
- **B1**: `['b', 'c']`

### Step 3: Remove Brackets and Combine Lists
To combine these lists, you can remove the brackets and then combine the values.

1. **Remove Brackets**: Use `SUBSTITUTE` to remove the square brackets.
   - In **C1**: 
   ```excel
   =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1, "[", ""), "]", "")
   ```
   - In **D1**:
   ```excel
   =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(B1, "[", ""), "]", "")
   ```

2. **Combine Lists**: Use `TEXTJOIN` to combine the two cleaned lists.
   - In **E1** (to get the combined list):
   ```excel
   =TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, C1, D1)
   ```

3. **Remove Duplicates** (Optional): Excel doesnâ€™t have a built-in function to remove duplicates in a string directly. However, you can use Power Query or VBA for this if necessary. 

### Example Formula in Excel:
If you want to do this without using VBA, here's a simplified process:

1. **In C1** (Remove brackets from A1):
   ```excel
   =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1, "[", ""), "]", "")
   ```

2. **In D1** (Remove brackets from B1):
   ```excel
   =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(B1, "[", ""), "]", "")
   ```

3. **In E1** (Combine C1 and D1):
   ```excel
   =TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, C1, D1)
   ```

### Final Output:
This will give you the result:
- **E1**: `'a', 'b', 'c'`

If you need the output to be formatted back as a list (with square brackets), you can add the following:

4. **In F1** (Format back as a list):
   ```excel
   ="[" & E1 & "]"
   ```

This will return:
- **F1**: `['a', 'b', 'c']`

### Important Notes:
- This method assumes that the list items are separated by commas within the brackets.
- Excel's functions are limited when it comes to handling lists natively, so more advanced manipulation (like removing duplicates) may require VBA or a different tool like Power Query.
