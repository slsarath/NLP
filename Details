Hi,

As discussed, I checked with Vaishali about the laptop upgrade process. She mentioned that the Line Manager needs to raise an IT request titled “Manage Personas” to change the individual’s persona from Agile to Developer. If the Developer persona is already assigned, no action is required.

Once this step is completed, the Line Manager should raise a request for a laptop upgrade, stating that it’s required for the Data Analyst role.

According to standard guidelines, both Developer and Data Analyst roles should have a developer-grade laptop.
