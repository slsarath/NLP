Just to clarify the distinction between Design Effectiveness Assessment (DEA) and Control Design Effectiveness (CDE), especially in the assurance context:
	•	DEA is done as part of the control testing process. It helps us confirm whether a control is well-designed to perform its intended function before we begin testing its operation. For example, we check if the control has the right logic, documentation, and ownership in place.
	•	CDE, on the other hand, is a broader, forward-looking assessment. It’s used during risk assessments or PRO mapping to check if the controls mapped to a specific risk are adequate and appropriate. The aim is to see whether the overall control design is strong enough to mitigate the identified risk.

In short:
	•	DEA = Is this control well-designed for testing?
	•	CDE = Are the right controls in place for this risk?
