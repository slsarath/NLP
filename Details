🎤 Script to Start the “Guess Your Colleague” Emoji Game

Hi everyone!
Hope you’re all doing great and ready for a little midweek fun 😄

As part of today’s team connect, we’ve planned a light-hearted activity called “Guess Your Colleague: Emoji + Secret” — and trust me, you’re going to enjoy this one.

👇 Here’s how it works:
	1.	You’ll be shown a set of emojis along with a fun little secret about one of your teammates.
	2.	Your job is to guess who it is — but don’t shout it out just yet! Please note your guesses in the Teams chat, in the same order as the slides, so we keep the suspense alive till the end.
	3.	While some colleagues gave us emoji with meanings, I’ve cleverly hidden the descriptions — because what’s the fun without a little decoding, right? 😄 The idea is to see how well you really know each other through these emoji puzzles!

Now, here’s the twist:
Afnaan will be taking you through the slides one by one.
Why Afnaan? Well, he doesn’t even know who the entries belong to — so he’s as unbiased and curious as the rest of you. That makes him the perfect host for the guessing part.

Once we’re done with all the slides, I’ll come back in to reveal who’s who — and maybe embarrass a few people in the process 😜

So, grab your detective hats and let’s get started!
Afnaan, over to you!

Let me know if you’d like to tweak the tone (more formal, more witty, etc.)!
