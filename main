Great question!

Here’s where and how you can open a terminal, depending on your setup:

Use Git Bash or Windows Terminal (recommended)

🔹 Git Bash (Easy if you installed Git for Windows):

	2.	Select “Git Bash Here”
	3.	You now have a terminal window

🔹 Windows Terminal or Command Prompt:
	•	Press Win + S → search for “Terminal” or “Command Prompt”
	•	You can also use Windows PowerShell

⸻

✅ Option 2: If You’re on macOS
	1.	Press Cmd + Space and search for “Terminal”
	2.	Open it — you can now enter all SSH/Git commands

⸻

✅ Option 3: If You’re on Linux
	1.	Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open your terminal

⸻

✅ Option 4: Inside VS Code (Cross-platform, recommended)
