Let me provide a quick demonstration.

For the prediction model, we trained the system using a set of pre-labeled data, where the business had already identified issues associated with consumer harm. Based on this data, we trained our model to generate probability scores for similar issues.

Similarly, for the semantic analysis model, the business provides us with specific categories and relevant phrases. We then develop a model that categorizes the phrases accordingly, ensuring accurate classification.
