Based on your resume and experience, here are strong, tailored answers to the behavioral questions using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format.

⸻

a. Encouraging Others to Challenge Processes & Improve

Question:
Describe a situation when you have encouraged other people to question established processes and suggest areas for improvement.
	•	How did you realise that your encouragement might be valuable?
	•	What specific steps did you take to encourage your colleagues?
	•	What was their response?
	•	What feedback did you get on your efforts?

Answer:

Situation:
At Barclays, during one of our recurring control assurance activities, I noticed that a large portion of our team’s effort was spent on manually testing the effectiveness of controls and validating large transaction reporting (LTR). The process had been followed for a long time, but I saw clear inefficiencies and inconsistencies.

Task:
Although the process had always been accepted as standard, I felt there was an opportunity to automate parts of it and improve accuracy. I realized my input could be valuable because I had both the data science skills and a deep understanding of the control objectives.

Action:
I initiated informal brainstorming sessions with peers across the control assurance and data teams to review the current process and encouraged them to think beyond the “this is how it’s always been done” mindset. I shared small proof-of-concepts, showing how Python scripts and Excel macros could automate data checks and improve traceability. I created a safe space for my colleagues to raise pain points and suggest enhancements, and highlighted how even small automations could drive real impact.

Result:
This led to the successful implementation of a semi-automated LTR testing framework that reduced manual effort by 60% and saved around 120 hours per month. Several colleagues appreciated the initiative and became more proactive in identifying further automation opportunities. I received positive feedback from my manager, who highlighted this as a strong example of bottom-up innovation in our year-end review.

⸻

b. Driving Innovation at Work

Question:
Describe an example of when you have achieved real innovation at work, either through an idea of your own or through an idea of someone else.
	•	What was the idea, and what made it innovative?
	•	What did you do with the idea when you got it?
	•	How did your actions benefit the organisation?

Answer:

Situation:
While working in the Control Assurance team at Barclays, I observed that risk event investigations often took significant time due to scattered data and lack of root cause visibility across units.

Task:
I wanted to find a more intelligent way to identify patterns across risk events and issues using unstructured narrative data and make the analysis proactive instead of reactive.

Action:
I proposed and developed an NLP-based semantic search system that used Sentence-BERT embeddings and FAISS indexing to retrieve similar historical events based on narrative content. This allowed assurance teams to quickly find similar issues, identify trends, and understand potential root causes across business units. I also integrated feedback mechanisms to refine results over time.

Result:
The solution significantly reduced the time spent on root cause analysis, improved knowledge reuse, and enhanced the quality of insights provided to senior management. It was recognized by leadership as a strong application of AI in proactive risk identification and was later shared as a best practice in an internal innovation forum. It also encouraged other teams to explore similar use cases with NLP and LLMs.

Here are detailed, STAR-format answers tailored to your experience, especially aligned with your role at Barclays and your previous leadership at HSBC. These demonstrate your ability to support change, coordinate transformation, and lead with clarity.

⸻

a. Supporting Others Through Change

Question:
Describe a situation when you supported other people through a change in the way work is done.
	•	How did you realise that your support might be valuable?
	•	What specific steps did you take to help your colleagues understand the reasons for the change?
	•	What feedback did you get on your efforts?
	•	What was the final outcome?

Answer:

Situation:
At Barclays, we initiated an automation project for Large Transaction Reporting (LTR) control testing. The existing manual process was time-consuming and varied slightly across reviewers, leading to inconsistencies and potential audit issues.

Task:
I developed a Python-based automation solution to standardize and streamline the control testing. While I was confident in the technical solution, I quickly realized that some colleagues were hesitant about the shift — mainly due to a lack of familiarity with automation and concerns about the transparency of logic.

Action:
I organized a series of short hands-on sessions to walk the team through the logic, explain how automation actually reduced manual errors, and demonstrate how the output aligned with audit requirements. I made sure to document the process in simple terms and created a feedback loop to adapt the tool based on their inputs, which made them feel more involved.

Result:
Over time, the team transitioned comfortably to the new approach, and manual effort dropped by over 60%. Feedback was highly positive — my manager acknowledged the collaborative transition approach during performance review discussions. The team appreciated how the change made their work easier and more traceable, rather than threatening.

⸻

b. Coordinating the Introduction of a New Way of Working

Question:
Tell me about a situation when you played a part in coordinating the introduction of a new way of working.
	•	What did you specifically do as part of making the change?
	•	How did you communicate information concerning the change to other people?
	•	How did you measure your success?
	•	What was the final result?

Answer:

Situation:
During my time at HSBC, we identified inefficiencies in how exception scenarios under Customer Due Diligence (CDD) were being handled — the process involved manual review and inconsistent documentation across teams.

Task:
I proposed building a visual dashboard to help risk and compliance teams track and analyze CDD control breaches in near real time, enabling them to prioritize reviews and interventions.

Action:
I worked closely with stakeholders to identify key metrics, collaborated with data teams for input pipelines, and used QlikSense to build an interactive dashboard. I rolled out the change through structured walkthroughs and demo sessions with end-users, ensuring they understood how it could simplify their daily analysis. I also created a reference guide and offered 1-on-1 support in the initial phase.

Result:
The adoption was quick — teams started using the dashboard within the first two weeks. I measured success through reduced turnaround time for issue identification and fewer clarification queries from stakeholders. Ultimately, it improved risk visibility and was later extended to other regions. I received direct appreciation from leadership for leading the change with both empathy and technical strength.

Here are strong, STAR-based responses for both behavioral questions, framed around your demonstrated experience in automation, cross-team collaboration, and data-driven problem solving.

⸻

a. Supporting Others to Manage Time and Resources

Question:
Tell me about a time when you provided support to other people in order to help them to manage time and resources.
	•	How did you approach this with those involved?
	•	How did you ensure they were able to maximise time and resources effectively?
	•	What feedback did you receive from them as a result?

Answer:

Situation:
In the Control Assurance team at Barclays, some team members were struggling to complete repetitive control testing tasks within tight deadlines — especially around Large Transaction Reporting. Much of their time was spent manually pulling, filtering, and validating data from different sources.

Task:
I noticed the bottleneck and volunteered to help them optimize their workflow by introducing automation without disrupting their existing responsibilities.

Action:
I first shadowed their process to understand pain points. Then I built a Python-Excel-based semi-automated tool that streamlined the data extraction and validation steps. I conducted short demo sessions to show them how the tool worked, created a user guide for reference, and customized it based on their feedback.

To help them manage their time better, I also suggested a simple checklist-based tracking approach to prioritize testing cycles and reduce rework.

Result:
The team was able to cut their task time by more than half and focus on quality assurance instead of manual operations. Several colleagues shared their appreciation, and one of them mentioned in our team forum that it was a “game-changer” for their workload. My manager recognized it during performance discussions as a key enabler of team productivity.

b. Helping Others Solve a Complex Problem

Question:
Describe a situation where you helped others to solve a complex problem.
	•	What specific steps did you take?
	•	What information did you suggest they gather and from whom?
	•	How did they use these insights to help solve the problem?
	•	What other considerations did you take into account?
	•	What was the final decision?
	•	How did it align with the organisation’s values?
	•	What was the short and long-term impact on key stakeholders?

Answer:

Situation:
At HSBC, the compliance team was facing challenges in identifying root causes behind recurring exceptions in Customer Due Diligence (CDD) reviews. The cases were complex, and manual investigation was time-consuming and inconsistent across reviewers.

Task:
I was approached to help design a data-driven approach to uncover deeper insights and trends behind these CDD breaches.

Action:
I first engaged stakeholders across compliance, operations, and data to understand their current review process and pain points. I suggested gathering:
	•	Case metadata (e.g. client type, region, reviewer)
	•	Text narratives from exception logs
	•	Analyst comments and flags

I then used topic modeling and clustering (via NLP techniques like LDA and K-means) to group similar exceptions and highlight underlying drivers — such as documentation gaps or mismatches in customer profiles.

We considered audit readiness, data privacy, and interpretability before finalizing the solution. I also ensured outputs were visualized clearly using dashboards for easy consumption by non-technical teams.

Result:
The final solution helped reduce investigation time, improved consistency, and supported proactive controls by highlighting recurring themes. It aligned with HSBC’s values of being dependable and doing the right thing — using data ethically to strengthen compliance. In the short term, it increased efficiency; in the long term, it influenced a change in how exception trends were reported and addressed globally.

Here’s a strong STAR-format response to question (c), tailored to your role and experience:

⸻

c. Adapting to Changing Requirements

Question:
Give me an example of a time when you have successfully adapted to changing requirements.
	•	What did you do to ensure you met your objectives?
	•	How did you support your colleagues in making changes?
	•	How did this help them realign to the new requirements?
	•	How did the business benefit as a result of your actions?

Answer:

Situation:
While working on a control automation initiative for Large Transaction Reporting (LTR) in Barclays, the original scope was to automate the test steps for one control type. Midway through the development, requirements shifted — the team was now asked to include additional control layers with different data sources and slightly varied logic. This required not only technical changes but also coordination across stakeholders to revalidate the use case.

Task:
My objective was to adapt the solution architecture without delaying delivery and ensure the team remained aligned and confident through the change.

Action:
I paused development to reassess the new requirements, then redesigned the workflow to make it modular — allowing different control logics to be plugged in dynamically. I scheduled a working session with control owners and fellow analysts to walk through the revised scope and explain how the new structure would support future flexibility. I provided updated documentation and built reusable templates so others could adapt quickly.

To ensure alignment, I helped my colleagues update their data validation logic and encouraged feedback through short daily sync-ups during the transition.

Result:
We delivered the updated solution within the original timeframe. The team was able to scale the same logic across other controls, which saved substantial rework for future projects. My adaptability helped maintain team momentum and earned appreciation from both my manager and the control testing team.

From a business standpoint, this reduced manual control testing time by 60%, improved traceability, and enabled consistent reporting — aligning well with the firm’s goals of operational resilience and process optimization.

⸻

Would you like a 2–3 line version of this story for panel-style rapid-fire questions?

Here are well-crafted STAR-format answers to all three risk-focused behavioral questions, aligned with your experience in control assurance, risk analytics, and automation at Barclays and HSBC.

⸻

a. Decision Involving Risk to the Organisation

Question:
Describe a situation when you made a decision that involved an element of potential risk to the organisation.
	•	What was the nature of the risk?
	•	What were the implications of making a poor decision?
	•	What factors did you take into account?
	•	What was the outcome?

Answer:

Situation:
While automating the Control Effectiveness Testing framework at Barclays, I had to decide whether to bypass a long-standing manual checkpoint to improve processing speed. The logic I introduced could streamline the test cases but if not implemented accurately, could result in incorrect control assessment — leading to potential audit exposure or misreporting.

Task:
The challenge was to balance automation efficiency with the robustness of risk controls, without compromising audit readiness or internal policy expectations.

Action:
I carefully reviewed historical test cases and consulted with control owners to identify key failure scenarios. I then introduced validation logic and traceability checkpoints in the Python automation script to mimic the manual review logic. Before full deployment, I ran the system in parallel with the manual process to compare results and ensure alignment. I also documented the logic for audit and change management.

Result:
The automation was approved and successfully rolled out with full confidence from stakeholders. The risk was mitigated through careful validation, and the change led to a 60% reduction in testing time without compromising control quality. The team appreciated the structured approach to balancing innovation with risk ownership.

⸻

b. Helping Others Understand Responsibility for Risk

Question:
Describe an example that shows how you have helped other people to understand their responsibility for risk
	•	How did you demonstrate the emphasis on risk control yourself?
	•	How did their behaviour change as a result?
	•	How did you judge your success?
	•	How did your actions benefit the organisation?

Answer:

Situation:
At HSBC, I led a project involving the analysis of exception cases in CDD (Customer Due Diligence). Many team members were treating the analytical steps as pure data tasks without appreciating the regulatory and reputational risks involved in misinterpreting exception causes.

Task:
I wanted to help the team understand that every insight generated had downstream risk implications and should be handled with a sense of accountability.

Action:
I introduced a risk-context lens to all team activities — during daily standups, I asked everyone to link their analysis back to the potential control failure or policy breach. I also shared examples where poor analysis led to audit flags or missed AML triggers. To lead by example, I tagged risk levels to exception clusters I worked on and clarified why those clusters needed escalation.

Result:
The team gradually adopted a more risk-aware mindset. Analysts began tagging high-risk cases proactively and escalated early when needed. My manager later highlighted this behavior shift as a positive cultural change in our year-end review. This contributed to improved documentation quality and faster detection of policy breaches, aligning directly with HSBC’s goals around enhanced compliance and ownership.

⸻

c. Recognising Risk and Notifying Others

Question:
Tell me about a situation when you recognised that the risk associated with a decision meant that you needed to notify someone else.
	•	How did you recognise that situation required you to act?
	•	What factors did you take into account?
	•	What specific steps did you take?
	•	What was the eventual outcome?

Answer:

Situation:
While building a model to analyze voice transcripts for trade surveillance at Barclays, I noticed that the auto-transcribed data was inconsistently capturing key terms such as “pre-trade mark” — a regulatory requirement. The NLP pipeline was showing high confidence, but I spotted gaps in the raw transcripts.

Task:
There was a risk that inaccurate transcription could lead to incorrect model conclusions — potentially causing a control failure in how we monitor regulatory disclosures.

Action:
I immediately paused the automation and raised the issue with the Legal & Compliance SMEs and the internal controls testing team. I shared examples and flagged this as a potential misrepresentation risk. We brought in an alternative transcription engine for comparison and retrained part of the pipeline using real case data.

Result:
The revised pipeline improved accuracy by over 30%, and the issue was documented as a lesson learned in our internal assurance forum. My early escalation prevented a potential control lapse and demonstrated strong risk vigilance, which was recognized in my mid-year review.

Answer:

Situation:
During my tenure at Barclays, I noticed a team member from the testing side was curious about data automation but didn’t have the technical exposure to work with Python or advanced Excel scripting.

Task:
Given the growing relevance of automation in our control testing work, I saw an opportunity to help him upskill and transition into a hybrid analyst role.

Action:
I designed a small side project involving the automation of a repetitive data validation task. I broke it down into manageable steps and paired up with him to guide the logic, helped set up his Python environment, and walked him through basic scripts. I encouraged him to explore online courses and made myself available during after-hours for quick debugging or questions.

What motivated me was his eagerness to learn and the alignment between his interest and the team’s future skill needs.

Result:
Within a couple of months, he developed the confidence to automate an internal reconciliation task independently, which was later adopted by others. He became more actively involved in our automation workstream and even presented a mini use case in a team sharing session. His capabilities significantly expanded, and my manager acknowledged this as an example of knowledge sharing that empowered growth within the team.

b. Supporting a Colleague to Exceed Expectations

Question:
Tell me about a situation when you supported a colleague to exceed expectations.
	•	What did you do to support them?
	•	How were you able to instil trust and belief?
	•	What did they achieve against expectations?

Answer:

Situation:
At Barclays, during the development of the Control Effectiveness Testing automation, a colleague from a non-technical background was assigned to co-lead the documentation and test logic validation stream. They were unsure if they could contribute effectively to a semi-technical project.

Task:
I supported them by explaining the logic behind the automation in plain language and invited them to review test case mappings and interpret outputs, helping bridge the gap between manual testing and the new tool.

Action:
I included them in technical walkthroughs, ensured they had early access to the scripts, and created mock scenarios for them to practice interpreting. I consistently reinforced that their domain knowledge was critical and showed them how their validation ensured the success of automation from an assurance lens.

Result:
Not only did they exceed expectations by spotting edge cases missed during early testing, but they also contributed ideas that improved output traceability. This collaborative effort was highlighted by our lead in a review meeting and demonstrated how cross-functional support can unlock hidden potential.

⸻

c. Setting High Standards to Drive Performance

Question:
Tell me about a time you set high standards to drive improved performance by yourself or your colleagues.
	•	Why was it so important to set high standards?
	•	How did you know these high standards were upheld and what did you do to maintain them?
	•	What was the impact on your or your colleagues’ performance?

Answer:

Situation:
While leading the development of an NLP-based root cause analysis system at Barclays, I set a high benchmark for accuracy, explainability, and audit-readiness because the output was directly used for assurance reporting to senior risk stakeholders.

Task:
It was critical that the solution didn’t just work, but was transparent, interpretable, and consistent across different teams and datasets.

Action:
I created evaluation benchmarks using precision-recall metrics and added traceability tags in the output to justify each cluster’s inclusion. I also reviewed every component of the pipeline with SMEs and sought feedback regularly. For the team, I set a standard that every model output had to be “explainable to a non-technical auditor.”

Result:
The result was a robust, production-ready solution that was praised for its practical usability and clarity. The team maintained these standards across similar future projects, and it helped establish a blueprint for responsible AI in our assurance workflows. It improved the team’s delivery quality and trust among internal risk stakeholders.

⸻

Situation:
At HSBC, I was leading a team of data analysts, one of whom consistently delivered high-quality technical work but often avoided participating in discussions with stakeholders or presenting their analysis. I noticed that while technically strong, they lacked confidence and weren’t aware of how this behavior limited their impact and visibility.

Task:
I wanted to help them become more self-aware of their strengths and development areas — particularly their potential to contribute beyond just coding.

Action:
In a one-on-one, I gave them positive reinforcement for their technical skills and gently shared observations on how their ideas often didn’t reach the right audience due to a lack of communication. I encouraged self-reflection by asking them what aspects of their role they found energizing and what made them hesitant in group settings. We worked together to define a development plan that included presenting updates in team calls and shadowing me in stakeholder meetings.

Result:
Within weeks, they started volunteering for internal demos and later led a walkthrough of a model they built. They acknowledged that the self-awareness conversations helped them realize their communication gap was a key area for growth. Over time, they evolved into a more well-rounded analyst, actively participating in planning meetings and earning recognition from the compliance team.

⸻

b. Supporting a Colleague to Improve Personal Effectiveness

	•	What did they do differently in the short- and long-term?

Answer:

Situation:
At Barclays, a colleague who recently transitioned into assurance analytics was struggling to manage multiple workstreams. They often missed internal deadlines and seemed overwhelmed by parallel asks, which impacted coordination with stakeholders.

Task:
I decided to help them improve their time management and prioritization without making them feel criticized.

Action:
We had an open discussion where I asked them to walk me through their weekly schedule and decision-making process. I highlighted their strength in delivering quality analysis and strong domain understanding, but also pointed out how task switching and lack of clear priorities were leading to delays. I introduced them to a simple task triage matrix (urgent vs important), helped set up a weekly planner, and suggested a 10-minute end-of-day review ritual.

Result:
In the short term, they began blocking calendar slots for focused work and started proactively flagging capacity issues. Within a month, their delivery improved significantly and they reported feeling more in control. In the long term, they took ownership of a time-sensitive compliance report and delivered it ahead of schedule — something they had previously struggled with.

b. Building and Maintaining a Cross-Network of Relationships

Question:
Describe a situation when you needed to build and maintain a network of relationships within and outside the organisation.
	•	How did you establish who to target?
	•	What was most difficult and how did you overcome this?
	•	How did your actions benefit both you and your team?

Answer:

Situation:
When I joined the Control Assurance team at Barclays, I was tasked with improving the root cause analysis framework using NLP — a project that needed input from multiple internal groups (testing, audit, risk owners) and a few external vendors for tooling options.

Task:
I needed to establish the right network across technical, operational, and control functions to collect inputs, validate outputs, and support eventual rollout.

Action:
I mapped key stakeholders based on data ownership, decision authority, and domain expertise. I initiated outreach through informal sync-ups, brown-bag sessions, and internal forums. The biggest challenge was managing differing expectations — the control team was focused on risk validity, while the data team emphasized model performance.

To bridge this, I tailored my messaging — using risk language with control owners and precision/recall metrics with analysts. I also created a shared view of how the solution aligned with regulatory standards and internal policy.

Result:
The project got wider buy-in and was delivered ahead of schedule. The relationships I built became valuable for future projects, and my team had smoother access to data and reviews thanks to this strong internal network.

Each group had valuable insights, but there wasn’t a structured platform for sharing learnings.

Task:
I wanted to break down these silos and create an environment where domain experts and data scientists could collaborate and learn from each other.

Action:
I proposed a bi-weekly “Assurance Innovation Hour” where teams could showcase ongoing use cases, walk through data models, or explain control-related logic. I reached out to individuals from each team, asked them to present relevant examples, and facilitated the first few sessions myself to build momentum. I also maintained a shared knowledge repository where learnings and resources were stored.

Result:
The sessions became popular, and more colleagues began participating proactively. It improved transparency, fostered better understanding between technical and functional teams, and sparked new collaborative ideas, including enhancements to the LTR testing process. Several team members mentioned in feedback that these sessions helped them upskill and understand how their work connected to broader risk goals.

	•	How did you use the different teams’ goals to help you?
	•	What was the outcome?

Answer:

Situation:
During a risk assurance project at HSBC, I was tasked with enhancing the AML monitoring system by incorporating machine learning. However, the compliance assurance team and the data science team had different priorities — one focused on risk mitigation, the other on technical performance.

Task:
My goal was to align both teams and ensure we delivered a solution that satisfied compliance needs while maintaining ML integrity.

Action:
I scheduled joint workshops to surface each team’s expectations and challenges. I mapped compliance goals (like reducing false positives and improving case closure timelines) to ML objectives (like model precision and feature relevance). I acted as a translator between both groups — helping data scientists understand risk language, and showing compliance how model decisions aligned with regulatory frameworks.

Result:
Cooperation improved significantly. The compliance team became more open to automation, and the data team began incorporating domain-driven features. The resulting model had a 20% improvement in alert quality and was adopted as a reference for other teams. Most importantly, it built mutual trust and established a foundation for future cross-team collaboration.
