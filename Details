Subject: Request for Folder and File Consistency for Automation Tool Debugging

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Upon review, we observed that the automation tool is designed to look for the folder corresponding to the last-to-last week’s Tuesday (04/03), which creates a new folder for the following Tuesday (11/03). However, the folder shared with us pertains to 25/02.

Additionally, we noticed that the file structure has been manually updated in some instances. For example, in the file provided, a blank line has been added at the beginning. Such manual changes may cause execution failures in the automation tool.

Kindly share the 04/03 folder with us so we can debug the current cause of failure. We would also appreciate it if you could review the earlier folders and files generated using the automation tool, ensuring consistency for manual runs.

To avoid any further inconsistencies and smoothen the operation, I would advise running the automation tool as scheduled—from the Tuesday of the previous week to the Monday of the current week. This will ensure the tool operates in a timely and consistent manner.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please let me know if you need any further clarification.
