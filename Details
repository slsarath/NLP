While executing a SELECT query in Impala via our Python script, I encountered an authorization exception indicating that the current user does not have the privileges required to run the query. This error suggests that the permissions assigned to my account (or the account in use) do not include SELECT operations, which may be due to our current security configurations or role assignments.

I am coordinating with our IT/security team to review and resolve the permission issue. I will keep you updated on the progress.
