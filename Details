Let's break down the provided SQL snippet to determine whether it satisfies the condition "An access authorizer cannot provision the same approved request."

### Key Components of the SQL Snippet:

1. **Ticket Status Check**:
   ```sql
   lower (REQ. TICKET_STATUS) = "provisioning'"
   ```
   - This part checks if the request's status is `"provisioning"`. This indicates that the request is in the provisioning phase.

2. **Assignee Key Validation**:
   ```sql
   reg. assignee_key IN (Select um.Usr_grp_key FROM pc.pc_us_grp_mem ugm, pc-pc_usg us WHERE usg-status-1 and ugm.status = 1 and usg-grp_key = ugm.usr_grp_key and upper(usg. responsiblity) in (select upper (RTK_NAME) from PS.PS_ATK_RTK where status-1 and role-''p") and ugm.usr_key = *|| VC_CURRENTUSERLOGIN|| )
   ```
   - The query checks whether the `assignee_key` (the person assigned to act on the request) belongs to a user group with a specific responsibility (`usg.responsibility`) and whether the `usr_key` matches the current user's login (`VC_CURRENTUSERLOGIN`).

3. **User Validation**:
   - Multiple `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT OUTER JOIN` operations link various user keys to ensure that the requester and assignee are different from the current user:
     ```sql
     INNER JOIN PC.PC_USR usr ON (C.requesteeUsrKey = us.usr_key and C.requesteeUsrKey<>*|| VC_CURRENTUSERLOGIN||)
     INNER JOIN PC.PC_USR usrRea ON (C.requesterUsrKey = usReq.usr_key and C.requesterUsrKey<>*|| VC_CURRENTUSERLOGIN||)
     LEFT OUTER JOIN PC.PC_USR inHandWith ON (C.assigneeUsrKey = inHandWith.usr_key)
     ```

4. **Duplicate Check**:
   ```sql
   where C.DUP = 1
   ```
   - This seems to be a check to ensure that there are no duplicates in the assignment, potentially ensuring that the same user is not assigned multiple times.

### Evaluation:

- **Provisioning Status**: The query is filtering requests with the status `"provisioning"`, meaning it is looking at requests that are already in the process of being provisioned.
  
- **User Responsibility and Assignment**: The query checks whether the current user is responsible for provisioning (`usg.responsibility`) and ensures that the assignee, requester, and current user are all distinct entities.

### Conclusion:

The query seems to be structured to prevent the same user (identified by `VC_CURRENTUSERLOGIN`) from acting as both the approver and the provisioner on the same request. This is indicated by the `INNER JOIN` conditions that ensure the requestee, requester, and assignee are different users and by checking the ticket status for `"provisioning"`.

**Therefore, the provided SQL snippet appears to satisfy the condition that an access authorizer cannot provision the same approved request.** The key here is the check that ensures the current user (potentially the authorizer) is not assigned to provision the request they have approved.
