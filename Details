Here’s how you can structure your stories based on the three pointers:
	1.	What women inspire you the most?
“The woman who inspires me the most is Kim, my peer and lead, with whom I’ve had the privilege of working closely for the past two years. She is someone who not only excels in project deliveries but also demonstrates unwavering dedication and leadership.”
	2.	What it is about them that really inspires you?
“What truly inspires me about Kim is her ability to lead by example. She manages projects with such precision and efficiency, always setting a standard for the team. Despite her busy schedule, she has consistently made time to mentor and support me, providing guidance in every step of my professional journey.”
	3.	What have you learned from them or how have they shaped you as an individual?
“Kim has taught me the importance of clear communication, meticulous planning, and being proactive in every aspect of project management. Her mentorship has shaped me into a more confident and capable professional, and her approach to leadership has inspired me to be not only a better colleague but also a mentor to others.”

This structure can serve as a heartfelt and meaningful tribute to Kim for International Women’s Day!
