Certainly! Building upon our earlier discussion on enhancing regulatory automation in a banking context, here‚Äôs how you can leverage publicly available datasets and Azure‚Äôs capabilities to develop a compelling hackathon solution:

‚∏ª

üîç Use Case Recap: Intelligent Control Testing Layer

Objective: Develop a GenAI-powered system that bridges the gap between regulatory obligations and practical control testing. This solution will:
	‚Ä¢	Map regulatory requirements to internal controls.
	‚Ä¢	Generate test cases for control assurance.
	‚Ä¢	Provide actionable insights for compliance teams.

‚∏ª

üìö Leveraging Available Data Platforms

Given the constraints of using only publicly available datasets, consider the following sources:
	1.	Data.gov: Offers a plethora of datasets related to U.S. federal regulations, compliance reports, and enforcement actions. Ôøº
	2.	Data.gov.uk: Provides access to UK government data, including regulatory guidelines and compliance metrics.
	3.	European Data Portal: Aggregates datasets from EU institutions, covering various regulatory frameworks and compliance standards.
	4.	Azure Open Datasets: While not specific to regulatory data, it offers datasets that can be used to enrich your model, such as economic indicators and public safety data.

üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solution Architecture

1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks
	‚Ä¢	Actions:
	‚Ä¢	Ingest regulatory documents and compliance reports from the aforementioned data sources.
	‚Ä¢	Clean and preprocess the data to extract relevant regulatory clauses and compliance metrics.

2. Regulatory Mapping:
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Azure Machine Learning, Azure Cognitive Services Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Actions:
	‚Ä¢	Use NLP models to identify and extract key regulatory requirements. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Map these requirements to standard control frameworks (e.g., COSO, COBIT).

3. Test Case Generation:
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Azure OpenAI Service Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Actions:
	‚Ä¢	Develop a GenAI model that generates test cases based on the mapped controls.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the test cases are actionable and align with industry best practices.

4. Dashboard & Reporting:
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Power BI, Azure Synapse Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Actions:
	‚Ä¢	Visualize the mapping between regulations and controls.
	‚Ä¢	Provide insights into areas lacking adequate control coverage. Ôøº

‚∏ª

üéØ Hackathon Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Prototype: A working model demonstrating the ingestion of regulatory data, mapping to controls, and generation of test cases.
	‚Ä¢	Dashboard: Interactive visualizations showcasing the regulatory landscape and control mappings.
	‚Ä¢	Documentation: Detailed explanation of the data sources used, model architecture, and potential real-world applications.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Next Steps
	1.	Data Exploration: Dive deeper into the datasets from Data.gov, Data.gov.uk, and the European Data Portal to identify specific regulatory documents relevant to banking. Ôøº
	2.	Model Development: Start with a small subset of regulations to train and validate your GenAI model.
	3.	Integration: Ensure seamless integration between data ingestion, model processing, and dashboard visualization.
