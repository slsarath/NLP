1.	Extract Numeric Value from Camp_Number:
Convert CAMP-XXX to numeric (e.g., CAMP-246 â†’ 246) so we can identify the latest campaign.
	2.	Sort the Data:
For each COI_ID, sort rows by extracted Camp_Number in ascending order.
	3.	Pick the Latest Campaign for Each COI:
For each COI_ID, keep only the last record (i.e., the row with the highest Camp_Number).
	4.	Filter Based on Applicability:
From the above latest records, filter only those where Applicability_Status = "Yes".
	5.	Return Final List:
Output the distinct COI_IDs that meet the criteria.
