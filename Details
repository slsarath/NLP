As part of the Issue Status Aging Analysis, we extracted historical issue status changes from the CDS database to understand how each issue progresses through various statuses over time.

In the attached example, you can see the number of working days it takes for an issue to transition from one status to another. While there is no documented standard defining specific timelines for each status change, based on current understanding, critical and major issues are expected to reflect status changes within 30 calendar days, and limited issues within 90 calendar days.

Using this benchmark, we have developed the MI for July data.

We also attempted to retrieve data for other months; however, due to recent changes in the CDS database, the change date information is currently unavailable. Once this data becomes accessible, we will extend the MI to cover those months as well.
