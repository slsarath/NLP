Hi Team,

As you know, our monthly team calls are back on the calendar, and to make them a little more interactive (and fun!), we’re starting off with a light game: “Guess the Emoji Bio + One Secret” 🔍✨

Here’s how it works:
	•	Send me a short emoji-only description (4–5 emojis) that reflects you — things you love, your personality, favorite food, hobbies, etc.
	•	Along with the emojis, also share one fun/interesting secret about yourself — something the team probably doesn’t know. 🤫
	•	During the call, I’ll read them both (without naming names), and the team will guess who it is!

Example:
Emoji Bio: 🎮🌶️📚🐱
Secret: I once binge-watched 5 seasons of a show in 3 days!

Please send yours to me by [insert deadline], and let’s see how well we really know each other!

Looking forward to some fun guesses! 😄
Cheers,
Sarath
