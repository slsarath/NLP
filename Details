Just to keep you informed — based on our current team capacity, my manager has assigned Shyam to take ownership of this project. As a result, I won’t be joining the upcoming meeting.

Shyam is across the details and will support the project going forward. Please feel free to reach out to him for any updates or discussions.

Thanks for your understanding!
