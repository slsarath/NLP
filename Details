Thank you for your response and for taking the time to review my profile.

While I am currently focused on pursuing Vice President-level opportunities, I truly appreciate your feedback. I will continue to upskill and further strengthen my profile to align with future opportunities at that level.

Looking forward to staying in touch, and thank you once again for your time and consideration.
