Pass/Fail status is based on the following criteria:
	•	Pass: No overdue transactions and no insufficient commentary.
	•	Fail – Timeliness: At least one overdue transaction and all commentary is sufficient.
	•	Fail – Commentary: No overdue transactions but at least one with insufficient commentary.
	•	Fail – Both: At least one overdue transaction and at least one with insufficient commentary.



Subject: Updated Results with Pass/Fail Categorization Based on Timeliness and Commentary

Dear [Stakeholder’s Name],

As discussed, please find the updated results attached, which now include a Pass/Fail categorization for each entity based on two key checks:
	1.	Whether the transactions were approved on time
	2.	Whether the commentary provided was complete and sufficient

To make it easy to interpret, we’ve categorized each entry as follows



Category
Criteria (Simple Terms)
Pass
All transactions are on time and commentary is sufficient
Fail – Timeliness
Some transactions were not approved on time
Fail – Commentary
All were on time, but some commentary is incomplete/unclear
Fail – Both
Both delays and insufficient commentary are observed

This categorization helps quickly identify areas needing improvement—whether it’s in processing transactions on time, improving commentary quality, or both.

Please review the attached file and let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results in more detail.
