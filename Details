Thank you again for your earlier update regarding the positive feedback from my interview. I wanted to check if there have been any further developments, as I haven’t yet received a formal update or seen any changes on the portal.

You had mentioned that the role may have moved from the UK to Dubai — if that’s the case, could you kindly confirm the current status? Also, if there is someone specific I should be in touch with for further updates, I’d appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
