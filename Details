Thank you for the meeting invite and for considering me for the project.

I wanted to inform you that, based on current team capacity and internal allocation, my manager has assigned Shyam to take ownership of this project moving forward. As a result, I will not be joining the upcoming meeting.

Shyam will be fully aligned and is well-equipped to support the project requirements. Please feel free to reach out to him directly for any further discussions or updates.

Thank you for your understanding.
