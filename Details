Here’s how risk, issue, and control are linked together in financial services:
	1.	Risk is the potential for something bad to happen.
	•	Example: A bank may face the risk of a customer not repaying a loan (default risk).
	2.	Control is put in place to prevent that risk from happening or to minimize its impact.
	•	Example: To reduce the risk of loan defaults, the bank checks the customer’s credit score, looks at their repayment history, and asks for collateral.
	3.	If the control is ineffective or not followed, it can lead to an issue.
	•	Example: If the credit check is not done properly, the bank might approve a loan for someone who can’t repay. This leads to the issue of the customer defaulting on their loan.

Linking them:
	•	Risk identifies the possibility of a problem (e.g., loan default).
	•	Control is the action or process taken to prevent or reduce the impact of the risk (e.g., credit score check).
	•	If the control fails, it can lead to an issue (e.g., the customer defaulting on the loan).

In summary:
	•	Risk is potential trouble.
	•	Control is a safety measure to avoid that trouble.
	•	Issue happens when the trouble (risk) occurs despite controls.
