I understand you're looking for a simpler solution to sort and remove duplicates from a list in Excel. Here's a step-by-step guide using a simpler approach:

### Steps to Sort and Remove Duplicates from a List in Excel:

1. **Assume You Have This List in Cell `A1`:**
   - `['c', 'b', 'a', 'c']`

2. **Step 1: Remove the Brackets and Quotes**
   - In cell `B1`, use the following formula to remove the square brackets `[` `]` and quotes `'`:
   ```excel
   =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1, "[", ""), "]", ""), "'", ""), " ", "")
   ```
   - This will leave you with: `c,b,a,c`

3. **Step 2: Split the List into Separate Cells**
   - Select a range of cells horizontally (e.g., `C1:F1`) and use the following formula:
   ```excel
   =TEXTSPLIT(B1, ",")
   ```
   - This will split `c,b,a,c` into separate cells: `C1: c`, `D1: b`, `E1: a`, `F1: c`

4. **Step 3: Remove Duplicates and Sort the Values**
   - In another range of cells horizontally (e.g., `G1:I1`), use the following formula to remove duplicates and sort:
   ```excel
   =SORT(UNIQUE(C1:F1))
   ```
   - This will give you the sorted, unique values: `G1: a`, `H1: b`, `I1: c`

5. **Step 4: Combine the Sorted List Back into a Single Cell**
   - Finally, in a new cell (e.g., `J1`), combine the sorted list back into a single string with square brackets:
   ```excel
   ="['" & TEXTJOIN("', '", TRUE, G1:I1) & "']"
   ```
   - This will result in: `['a', 'b', 'c']`

### Summary of the Steps:
1. Remove brackets and quotes from the original list.
2. Split the cleaned list into separate cells.
3. Use `SORT` and `UNIQUE` to sort the values and remove duplicates.
4. Combine the sorted and unique list back into a formatted string.

This approach is easier to follow and manually breaks down the process into manageable steps, ensuring that you achieve the desired output.
