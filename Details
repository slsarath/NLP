Hi Deepika,

As discussed, the error occurred due to changes in the input files, specifically the renaming of one of the sheets.

Please note that the functionality of the automation tool is built based on the process document that was shared. Any changes to the file format or structure, such as renaming sheets or modifying columns, will impact the tool’s execution and may result in failures.

We have updated the tool, tested it, and it is now working as expected. The only modification made was the addition of the renamed sheet to the configuration file.

To help avoid similar issues in the future, I’d like to suggest the following best practices:
	1.	Run the tool on a weekly basis to maintain consistency and avoid manual intervention, as manual changes are more likely to introduce structural discrepancies in the files generated by the automation tool.
	2.	Reduce the row count in the files by archiving older data. We have noticed that most files contain data from 2023. It would be more efficient to retain only the relevant data for 2025, which will help optimize file size and performance.
	3.	Train your team on using the tool to avoid dependency on individuals. This will ensure that the tool can be operated smoothly and effectively by the team without any bottlenecks.

Please let me know if you have any queries or require further assistance.

Thanks,
S
