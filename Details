Further to our discussion, please find the attached updated output file.

Kindly consider this as the Phase 1 result. The insights and learnings from this phase can be leveraged to shape and develop the requirements for Phase 2.

As discussed, for Phase 1, we are not applying the sampling criteria for bankers across the full year of assessment (i.e., assessing only 50% of bankers in Q1). Instead, we have provided the assessment for all bankers and transactions within the quarter.

Please review the file at your convenience. I will schedule some time on Friday to address any queries or clarifications you may have.
