Here’s a script you can use to walk your stakeholder through the Tableau dashboard shown in the image:

⸻

“Let me walk you through the dashboard we’ve created for Issue Risk Assessment.”
	1.	Top Section – Issue Narrative Analysis (Bar Chart by Month)
	•	This section visualizes the quality assessment of issue narratives raised from July to December 2024.
	•	Each vertical bar represents the total number of issues identified in that month, with the percentage breakdown of quality:
	•	Green shows “Quality Likely Good”
	•	Yellow/Orange indicates “Quality Needs Improvement”
	•	Red highlights “Quality Likely Poor”
	•	For instance, in August 2024, about 14.95% of issues were good quality, but a significant 53.27% were poor, showing room for improvement in how narratives are drafted.
	2.	Bubble Labels (on top of bars)
	•	These represent the number of issues raised that month. So, we can quickly compare month-on-month volume and quality trends.

⸻

	3.	Middle Section – Issue Details Table
	•	This table provides granular-level details for each issue:
	•	Issue ID, Status, Rating, First Identified Date, Due Date, and whether PII is present.
	•	This helps to track status and identify patterns, for instance, recurring issues with missing PII or long resolution timelines.

⸻

	4.	Bottom Tabs – Deeper Insights
	•	Linked Controls Distribution: This will show how many issues are mapped to controls and their effectiveness.
	•	Control Narrative Quality Assessment: Complements the issue quality view by analyzing the quality of control documentation supporting the issues.

“This dashboard not only gives us a month-wise trend of issue volume and quality, but also allows us to drill down into individual records and see where improvement is needed. It helps both in assurance planning and proactive remediation discussions with issue owners.”

Let me know if you’d like a version tailored for a senior executive or technical team.




So regarding the view you requested – I wanted to clarify that the layout you’re looking for can’t be accommodated in the existing pivot directly without disturbing the current setup. But the good news is, we don’t need to create a separate pivot altogether. I’ll quickly walk you through how to adjust it in just a few clicks.”
	1.	“First, go to the Pivot Table and drag the ‘Banker’ field into the Rows section.”
	•	This will give you a row-wise breakdown by Banker.
	2.	“Next, drag the ‘Failed Count’ or whatever field represents the failed numbers into the Values section.”
	•	This will populate the count of failures against each banker.
	3.	“And finally, if you want to focus on a particular Business area, just drag the ‘Business’ field into the Filters section and select the relevant one.”

“That should give you the view you’re looking for, and you can save this as a custom view going forward. Let me know if you’d like me to stay while you try it out.”
