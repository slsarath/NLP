Things to Note:
	•	Avoid starting with the name of the game, as it may prompt people to consciously observe who is turning their cameras ON.
	•	Begin by explaining the game and only share Steps 1 and 2 initially to keep the process simple and discreet.
	•	Once all the months have been completed, proceed to Step 3, asking participants to list down the names with the corresponding months in the Teams chat.
	•	This approach will help maintain the element of surprise and keep the game a secret.
