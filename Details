	•	Heavily Manual Processes:
Existing manual and semi-automated controls are resource-intensive, prone to human error, and lack scalability.
	•	Periodic Assessments Insufficient:
Scheduled testing intervals miss rapidly evolving threats, leaving significant windows of vulnerability, exposing Barclays to potential breaches, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm.
	•	Limited Real-time Visibility:
Limited real-time risk detection and prioritization slow down threat response, reducing resilience in facing sophisticated cyber threats.
