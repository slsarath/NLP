To solve the problem of comparing the derivative product order timestamp with the chat transcripts timestamp, where the chat transcripts are stored in a third-party application and are only available in a zipped format, here are the possible solutions using Python:

1. Automate the Download Process:

You will need to automate the process of downloading the chat transcripts. Depending on the third-party application, you may use one of the following methods:

a. Using APIs (if available):
	•	If the third-party application provides an API for downloading the transcripts, you can write a Python script that interacts with the API to download the chat transcript files.
Example:

import requests

url = "https://example.com/api/chat_transcripts"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open('chat_transcripts.zip', 'wb') as file:
        file.write(response.content)



b. Using Web Scraping (if API isn’t available):
	•	If there is no API and you can download the file manually, you can use tools like Selenium or BeautifulSoup to automate the downloading process from the web interface.
Example using Selenium to download a file:

from selenium import webdriver
import time

# Start the driver and open the web page
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com/chat-transcripts")

# Interact with the page (e.g., login, click download button)
# driver.find_element_by_id("download_button").click()

# Wait for the download to complete
time.sleep(10)
driver.quit()

2. Extract Data from ZIP File:

Once you have the ZIP file, you can use Python to extract and read the data from the zip file.

import zipfile
import os

# Path to the downloaded zip file
zip_file_path = 'path_to_zip/chat_transcripts.zip'
extract_folder = 'path_to_extract_folder'

# Unzip the file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extract_folder)

3. Process the Extracted Files (If in CSV, JSON, or Text Format):

After extraction, the chat transcripts will likely be in CSV, JSON, or text format. You can process these files using appropriate Python libraries.
	•	For CSV files:

import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
chat_df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(extract_folder, 'chat_transcript.csv'))

# Process the timestamps and match with orders
chat_df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(chat_df['timestamp'], format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')


	•	For JSON files:

import json

with open(os.path.join(extract_folder, 'chat_transcript.json'), 'r') as f:
    chat_data = json.load(f)

# Extract timestamp information
timestamps = [entry['timestamp'] for entry in chat_data]


	•	For Text files:

with open(os.path.join(extract_folder, 'chat_transcript.txt'), 'r') as file:
    chat_lines = file.readlines()

# Process text to extract timestamp (if needed)

4. Comparing with Order Timestamps:

Once you have both the order timestamps (from the orders dataset) and the chat transcript timestamps (extracted from the files), you can compare the timestamps.

Example: Matching Order Timestamp with Chat Transcript Timestamp

# Example DataFrames for orders and chat transcripts
orders_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'order_id': [1, 2, 3],
    'order_timestamp': pd.to_datetime(['2025-02-01 10:05:00', '2025-02-01 11:15:00', '2025-02-01 12:25:00'])
})

# Assuming chat_df has been loaded as mentioned in earlier steps
chat_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'chat_id': [101, 102, 103],
    'timestamp': pd.to_datetime(['2025-02-01 10:06:00', '2025-02-01 11:20:00', '2025-02-01 12:30:00'])
})

# Merge or compare the dataframes based on timestamps (with a tolerance, if needed)
merged_df = pd.merge_asof(orders_df, chat_df, left_on='order_timestamp', right_on='timestamp', direction='nearest', tolerance=pd.Timedelta('1 min'))

print(merged_df)

This will match orders with the closest chat timestamps within the specified tolerance.

5. Automated Reporting or Alerts:

You can automate reporting or flagging any discrepancies in timestamp matches by using Python’s data analysis tools.
	•	Create an alert system for mismatched timestamps.
	•	Generate a report showing mismatched timestamps and their corresponding order details.

Example:

# Identify mismatches
mismatched_rows = merged_df[merged_df['order_timestamp'] != merged_df['timestamp']]

# Generate a report
mismatched_rows.to_csv('mismatched_transactions.csv', index=False)

Summary of Solution:
	•	Automate Data Extraction: Use APIs or web scraping (if needed) to automate the downloading of chat transcripts.
	•	Extract Data from ZIP: Use Python’s zipfile to extract files from the downloaded ZIP.
	•	Process Extracted Files: Use appropriate libraries (pandas, json, etc.) to parse the data and extract timestamps.
	•	Compare Timestamps: Use Python’s merge_asof() to compare the order timestamps with chat transcript timestamps, adding tolerance for near matches.
	•	Automate Reports: Generate reports or alerts for discrepancies.
