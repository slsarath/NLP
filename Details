Please find below the key discussion points and action items from our meeting:
	1.	Timeliness Check:
	•	As discussed, we will only consider the “day counter” field for the timeliness check.
	•	This is due to potential discrepancies between the transaction date and the reporting date.
	2.	Completeness Check Review:
	•	The quality of the completeness check needs to be reviewed.
	•	Action Item: Jackie and Yunus will review this and provide an update by 14th [Month].

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification.
