Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I'm excited to present our RCA Thematic Analysis project, which aims to identify the primary root cause themes of risk events and issues. The objective here is to provide a comprehensive business-level view of thematic risk profiles, ultimately helping us prevent the recurrence of financial and non-financial impacts.

### Data Processing

We start with the input text, which is subjected to data preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. The preprocessed data is then fed into different modules for further analysis.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

1. **Named Entity Recognition**: This step involves identifying named entities within the text. We utilize HR data to identify person names and employee names accurately. This is crucial for pinpointing specific individuals involved in events.

2. **Regex Matcher**: In parallel, we use regex matching to extract specific entities like account numbers, emails, addresses, prices, and more from the text.

### Phrase Extraction

1. **Negative Phrases and Dependency Phrases**: We extract negative phrases and dependency phrases from the text. These phrases are crucial as they highlight potential risk areas and dependencies between different elements within the text.

2. **Spacy POS Tagging**: The extracted phrases are then tagged using Spacy POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging. This helps in identifying the grammatical structure and categorizing the phrases accurately.

3. **Spacy Dependency Parsing**: Next, we use Spacy Dependency Parsing to understand the relationship between words in a sentence. This is particularly useful for identifying cause-effect relationships within the text.

### Issue Lexicons

1. **Issue Lexicons**: We maintain a set of predefined issue lexicons, which are used to tag phrases found in the text. If a phrase matches an issue lexicon, it is tagged accordingly.

### Issue Classification Logic

Finally, all the tagged phrases and identified entities are fed into our issue classification logic. This logic classifies the issues based on predefined categories and tags. 

### Results

The result is a comprehensive dashboard that provides a business-level view of the thematic risk profile over a period of time. This dashboard offers insights into trends, cause-effect relationships, seasonality, and more, based on the themes obtained from risk events and issues. This enables us to take proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance our overall risk management strategy.

By analyzing these themes, we can better understand the root causes of risk events, allowing us to implement more effective controls and prevent similar issues in the future. This project not only helps in risk management but also supports continuous improvement in our processes and policies.
