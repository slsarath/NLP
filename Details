Here’s a crisp 3-minute script for your presentation on the automation QA tool you’ve built, tailored to highlight background, how it works, and its impact:

🔹 [Start – Background | ~30 seconds]

“Hi everyone,
I wanted to quickly share how the Rationale QA tool we developed has significantly streamlined our RCSA process.

To give a bit of background — during the Inherent Risk Assessment (IHR) phase of the RCSA programme, over 58,000 Process-Risk-Org combinations were created, each requiring a rationale. Manually reviewing these for quality would’ve been a massive effort — close to 290 days of work, even with a dedicated team of four engagement leads.

This made it clear we needed an automated, intelligent way to perform quality assurance at scale.”

🔹 [Middle – How the Tool Works | ~45 seconds]

“The tool automates rationale review by applying a rule-based and NLP-assisted logic to assess if each rationale meets defined quality standards — things like clarity, completeness, consistency, and relevance.

It flags rationales that fall short of criteria — essentially highlighting where remediation is required.
The tool integrates with our workflow, provides scoring and comments, and updates dynamically as new PROs are added.”

🔹 [End – Value Addition | ~1.5 minutes]

“During the IHR phase alone, the tool helped us identify around 14,000 rationales that didn’t meet the criteria — enabling early and focused remediation by our engagement leads.

In the control assessment window, the tool flagged 2,500 more rationales needing improvement. Without the tool, this level of review would’ve been impossible.

This has not only saved hundreds of manual review days but also ensured that the business teams received timely and accurate feedback — improving overall quality, transparency, and audit-readiness.

Going forward, we’re keen to enhance the tool further — possibly with more advanced ML/NLP capabilities — to keep raising the bar on rationale quality.

So in short, this tool is turning an otherwise unmanageable task into a scalable and consistent process, while significantly boosting efficiency and governance.”
