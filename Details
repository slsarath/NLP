Please find attached the draft output file for the erroneous payments analysis, based on our current model.

Kindly review the file and verify if the tagging aligns with the EP categorization.

Additionally, we have identified other emerging themes such as fat finger errors, valuation discrepancies, and settlement issues. If required, we can include these themes in the next delivery.
