Hi Team,

Based on the queries raised around our proposed idea, I’ve done some additional research and refined our approach to clearly differentiate it from existing solutions like CUBE.

The attached document provides a detailed overview of the CUBE platform, highlights our idea’s unique value proposition, and frames it as a custom-built prototype focused on control assurance and internal integration.

Request you all to please go through the attachment before our next discussion, as it will help us align better on the use case and next steps.
