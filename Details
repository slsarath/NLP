Subject: Updated Mapping Logic and Output File for PRO Matching

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

As discussed earlier, in the previously shared output file, the PRO mapping was based solely on the Primary Impacted Org, since the RCSA Org field had null values in most cases. For the specific risk highlighted below, there was no matching record in the PROC report, which is why the mapping was unsuccessful.

However, in the updated file attached, I’ve revised the logic to include RCSA Org in the PRO combination. This has allowed us to successfully map the mentioned risk, as the combination now matches with the PROC dataset.

We are now checking against both Impacted Org and RCSA Org to improve coverage.

Note: There are still around 300 events that remain unmapped, as no matching PRO combination exists in the PROC report for these cases.

Please review the attached updated output and let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
