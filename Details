Thanks for the clarity, Sarath! Since this is an internal VP-level interview at Barclays, the introduction should reflect:
	‚Ä¢	Your existing contributions within Barclays
	‚Ä¢	Your understanding of the firm‚Äôs culture, controls, and expectations
	‚Ä¢	Your readiness to take the next step in leadership while still showing humility and growth mindset

Here‚Äôs the refined, internal-facing self-introduction:

üíº Internal VP-Level Self-Introduction for Barclays

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Sarath, currently working as an Assistant Vice President ‚Äì Data Scientist within the Control Assurance team here at Barclays. Over the past decade, and especially in my current role, I‚Äôve focused on driving innovation at the intersection of data science, risk, and regulatory compliance.

At Barclays, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to lead and implement several impactful initiatives ‚Äî from developing NLP-based semantic search for root cause analysis, to automating control effectiveness testing and large transaction reporting. These efforts have not only improved accuracy and reduced manual hours but also contributed to more proactive and consistent assurance outcomes across the organization.

While I currently operate as an individual contributor, I‚Äôve previously led a team of data analysts at HSBC, where I mentored the team and delivered risk models for AML and compliance monitoring. That experience helped shape my leadership approach ‚Äî one that‚Äôs collaborative, hands-on, and focused on building trust across business and technical teams.

I‚Äôm deeply aligned with Barclays‚Äô values around stewardship, integrity, and service. My approach has always been value-first ‚Äî ensuring that the AI/ML solutions we build are not only technically sound but also responsible, explainable, and embedded with the right controls. Whether it‚Äôs through automation, model transparency, or stakeholder engagement, I strive to build solutions that are scalable, sustainable, and compliance-ready.

This VP role feels like a natural progression ‚Äî an opportunity to build on the foundation I‚Äôve laid, take on greater leadership responsibility, and contribute more strategically to our vision for intelligent and risk-aware decision-making across the enterprise.‚Äù
