Here’s how the use case would be carried out using issues, risk events, and actions datasets:

1. Enhanced Efficiency: Automating Vulnerability Detection in Risk Events and Issues

Scenario: You are tasked with reviewing the control environment around identified risk events and issues. Traditionally, this involves manually analyzing large volumes of data to spot potential vulnerabilities or areas of non-compliance.

How AI Helps: Generative AI can automatically scan through the risk events and issues datasets to detect patterns that suggest vulnerabilities, such as recurring security incidents, unaddressed risks, or gaps in controls.

Example: Let’s say the dataset contains multiple events of data breaches over the past year. The AI identifies that many of these breaches were related to outdated software versions. It then generates suggestions for mitigating these vulnerabilities, such as updating software or changing firewall configurations. This increases efficiency, as you don’t have to manually sift through the dataset to identify root causes.

2. Improved Accuracy: Detecting Hidden Threats in Actions and Risk Events

Scenario: While reviewing the actions dataset, you need to evaluate whether the actions taken to mitigate risks are effective and whether any hidden threats are being overlooked.

How AI Helps: AI can analyze historical data from the actions dataset, cross-referencing it with the risk events dataset to identify incomplete or ineffective actions. It can also flag behaviors or trends that point to emerging risks, such as recurring issues or delayed actions.

Example: AI analyzes past actions related to phishing incidents and notices that even though certain actions were marked as complete, similar incidents have occurred again. The AI flags this pattern and suggests reviewing the effectiveness of the actions taken. This improves the accuracy of your control assurance reviews by identifying hidden gaps that might otherwise be missed.

3. Automation in Testing: Simulating Adversarial Strategies in Risk Events and Issues

Scenario: You need to ensure that existing controls are robust enough to prevent future risk events, based on the patterns identified in the risk events and issues datasets. Traditionally, you would rely on red team testing, but this is a resource-heavy and time-consuming process.

How AI Helps: Generative AI can simulate potential future risk events by running different adversarial attack scenarios on the data. It can also analyze how previous risk events were handled and suggest improvements.

Example: AI runs a simulation based on historical data showing that certain controls failed during a data breach event. It generates a scenario where the same control fails but in a different context, such as a phishing attack. By identifying this gap, AI recommends additional safeguards, such as multi-factor authentication or enhanced user training. This helps you validate and strengthen controls more efficiently.

By applying Generative AI specifically to issues, risk events, and actions datasets,
