Thank you for keeping me informed about the transition of the role from Glasgow to Pune and the creation of a new requisition ID.

As I had completed the first round of interviews for the Glasgow role and received positive feedback, I just wanted to check whether that outcome can be considered for the Pune role, or if it would be better to restart the process from the first round.

I completely understand that such transitions involve certain process changes, and I’m happy to follow whatever steps are required. Please let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to do in the meantime.

I truly appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process.
