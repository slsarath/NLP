Here’s your revised 90-second winning script, clearly structured, engaging, and including the explicit transition statement at the end for handing over to Akshay:

⸻

[Start with energy and urgency (0–20 secs)]
“Did you know that cybersecurity breaches cost financial institutions globally over 5 trillion pounds annually? Recent breaches, such as the MOVEit cyberattack, significantly impacted banks—leading to massive financial losses and intense regulatory scrutiny. Clearly, proactive risk management has never been more critical.”

⸻

[Explain the problem clearly and personally (20–50 secs)]
“When we analyzed our internal data from the past two years, we uncovered a striking insight: we’ve had approximately 250 cybersecurity-related issues, resulting in financial impacts of nearly 1.45 billion GBP. Further analysis revealed that 65–70% of our cybersecurity controls are either manual or semi-automated, making them resource-intensive and prone to human error. This reactive, periodic approach limits our ability to detect cyber risks quickly enough, increasing Barclays’ vulnerability to evolving cyber threats and potentially severe financial and reputational impacts.”

⸻

[Clearly state your objective (50–70 secs)]
“Our objective is clear: transform cybersecurity control assurance at Barclays from reactive and manual, to proactive and intelligence-driven, powered by Generative AI.”

⸻

[Transition to Akshay (explicit handover)]
“To take you through how Generative AI can revolutionize our approach and the tangible benefits it will bring to Barclays, I’ll now hand it over to Akshay.”

⸻
