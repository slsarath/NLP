1. Hidden Formulas or Corrupted Cells

Even if you see no formula, some cells might have:
	•	Array formulas
	•	Invisible references
	•	Corrupted metadata (especially after programmatic edits like openpyxl or pandas.to_excel())

Fix:
	•	Select all cells (Ctrl + A), then press Ctrl + ` (the backtick key) to show formulas.
	•	Use Go To Special > Formulas to check if any formulas exist.
	•	Copy the entire sheet, then paste values-only into a new workbook.

2. Excessive Rows/Columns

Sometimes Excel thinks you’re using thousands of blank rows or columns due to past formatting or data.

Fix:
	•	Press Ctrl + End — if it goes far beyond your data, that’s the problem.
	•	Delete all unused rows/columns beyond your actual data.
	•	Save and reopen.

3. File Created via Script (e.g. pandas.to_excel)

When writing from Python, Excel sometimes flags corrupted formatting, merged cell remnants, or inconsistent cell types.

Fix:
	•	Open the file, select all cells, copy and paste into a new workbook as values.
	•	Re-save and open again.
