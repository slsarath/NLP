Here’s how you can structure your explanation for the status update call with the stakeholder:

1. Context and Objective

Begin by setting the context and reminding the stakeholder about the project’s objective:
	•	Example:
“The objective of this project was to assess the feasibility of accessing the required platform using a REST API to retrieve details of equity products for further analysis or reporting.”

2. Progress Made So Far

Explain what you’ve accomplished to date:
	•	Example:
“I’ve successfully established a connection to the platform using the REST API. The connection setup was completed without any issues, and I’ve been able to authenticate and initiate requests to the API.”

3. Current Challenges

Highlight the challenges you’ve encountered, keeping the explanation concise but clear:
	•	Example:
“While I was able to connect to the API, I encountered a limitation when trying to fetch equity product details. The API relies on two required filters—an ID and a code—in the request body. Without these filters, the API does not allow access to the full details of equity products. I confirmed this behavior after discussions with the IT team, who clarified that this is how the API has been designed.”

4. Next Steps

Outline the steps you plan to take to resolve or address the issue:
	•	Example:
“Given this limitation, the next steps would include:
	1.	Identifying how we can obtain the required ID and code filters for equity products.
	2.	Collaborating with the IT team to explore if there’s an alternative API or configuration to fetch the data without these specific filters.
	3.	Evaluating if any workaround or batch processing option can be implemented for larger data extraction.
I’ll provide further updates as we progress on these points.”

5. Open Discussion

Conclude by inviting input or direction from the stakeholder:
	•	Example:
“I wanted to bring this challenge to your attention and hear your thoughts or suggestions on how we could approach this issue. If there are any specific requirements or priorities, I’d be happy to incorporate them into the next steps.”

Sample Summary for the Call:
	1.	Objective: Assess feasibility of accessing the platform via REST API.
	2.	Progress: Successfully connected to the API and initiated requests.
	3.	Challenge: Unable to fetch equity product details without providing the required filters (ID and code).
	4.	Next Steps: Work with IT to explore alternative solutions or obtain the necessary filters.
	5.	Discussion: Invite suggestions from stakeholders on how to proceed.

This approach ensures you present your progress clearly while showing proactive planning for the challenges encountered. Let me know if you’d like to refine this further!

Here’s how you can frame your meeting points and script for providing a status update to your stakeholder about the automation project:

1. Meeting Points

Introduction
	•	Recap the project objective: Automating data filtering based on specific criteria to simplify and speed up user processes.
	•	Highlight the importance of the project: Explain how the tool will reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and save time.

Progress Update
	•	Mention that a prototype has been developed.
	•	Highlight key features of the prototype:
	1.	A user-friendly interface where users can upload input files.
	2.	The ability to select the date and apply specific filters.
	3.	Automatic processing of the data based on the selected criteria.
	4.	Output generation in an Excel-based format for further use.

Outstanding Queries
	•	Clarify that there are some ambiguities regarding the filtering criteria.
	•	Share specific examples of queries or areas where clarification is needed.
	•	Example: “For filter X, should the application exclude partial matches or include them?”
	•	Example: “Are there additional parameters users might need beyond those currently implemented?”

Next Steps
	•	Discuss what needs to be done after clarifying the filter criteria:
	1.	Enhancements to the prototype based on feedback.
	2.	Testing the tool with real data for validation.
	3.	Gathering user feedback to finalize the tool.
	•	Propose a timeline for further development and implementation.

Engagement
	•	Request stakeholder input on the filter criteria and invite suggestions for improvements or additional features.

2. Script for the Meeting

Introduction

“Thank you for joining the call. As part of this project, our goal was to create an automated solution to filter and process data based on the specified criteria, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent accuracy. I’d like to provide an update on our progress so far and discuss a few areas where we need clarification.”

Progress Update

“We’ve successfully developed a prototype for the tool. Here’s how it works:
	•	Users can upload their input files via a simple and intuitive interface.
	•	They can input the date they’re working with and select the filtering criteria as needed.
	•	Based on these inputs, the application processes the data automatically and generates an Excel-based output file for their use.”

“This prototype showcases the potential of the automation and demonstrates the initial functionality we’ve built.”

Queries on Filtering Criteria

“While developing the prototype, we’ve identified a few areas where additional input is needed to ensure the tool meets expectations. For example:
	1.	Should certain filters include partial matches or only exact matches?
	2.	Are there additional filter parameters users might require?
	3.	Is there a specific format for the output data that users prefer?”

“Clarifying these points will help us refine the prototype and move closer to the final product.”

Next Steps

“Once we receive clarification on the filtering criteria, we will:
	1.	Update the prototype to incorporate the required adjustments.
	2.	Test the tool with real data to ensure it functions as intended.
	3.	Gather feedback from users to identify any further improvements.”

“I’d also propose conducting a demo of the prototype once these updates are complete to gather more detailed feedback.”

Engagement

“I’d appreciate it if you could provide your input on the questions we’ve raised or let us know if there are any additional features or considerations we should include. Your guidance will ensure the tool aligns with the expectations and needs of its users.”

This structure ensures you effectively communicate progress, address any concerns, and engage stakeholders in shaping the final product. Let me know if you’d like to refine it further!
