	1.	For security, we are considering all three flags. However, when I requested the extraction from IT for all equity securities-type products, I noticed that no products have a blank flag.
	2.	There is a description column available in the extraction file, but I couldn’t identify any relevant terms related to ESG.
	3.	Regarding the desired output request, I will consult with my lead and get back to you with the necessary infrastructure support.
	4.	Could you please elaborate on the requirements for the activity report? I’m not entirely clear on the “what” and “how” sections of the request.
