Here’s a revised version of your script incorporating AWS Transcribe and NLP, which should fit well within your time while making a strong impact:

Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.

Today, I’m excited to present an idea that I believe can significantly improve our current assurance and surveillance processes for trade monitoring, particularly around voice recordings.

The problem:

Currently, our analysts manually listen to voice recordings to verify whether key information, such as pre-trade marks, was properly communicated. They also check for important details, such as whether the trade occurred at the right time, the exact price of the trade, and if any breaches occurred. This process is not only time-consuming—taking an average of 10 minutes per call—but also highly dependent on manual effort, which increases the risk of errors. With approximately 20 recordings per week, this can easily lead to 200 minutes of manual review for just one analyst. This workload only scales up when you consider larger data sets or different regions.

The solution:

What if we could automate this process to save both time and effort while improving accuracy? That’s where our solution comes in, leveraging AWS Transcribe for voice transcription and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract relevant information directly from the transcribed data.

Here’s how it works:

	1.	First, we use AWS Transcribe to automatically convert voice recordings into text. This allows us to work with structured data, removing the need for analysts to listen to each recording manually.
	2.	Second, we apply NLP to analyze the transcriptions and extract key elements such as pre-trade marks, timing, prices, and any breaches related to trade activity. This not only ensures that the correct information is being reviewed but also allows for quick identification of any inconsistencies or breaches.
	3.	Finally, the generated insights are formatted into standardized reports that align with our surveillance and assurance needs. This way, the process can be scaled across various regions and markets while maintaining consistency.

Key benefits:

	•	Time savings: With AWS Transcribe and NLP, what used to take analysts hours can now be reduced to minutes.
	•	Accuracy and consistency: By automating key parts of the process, we can minimize human error and ensure uniformity in the information being reviewed across different markets.
	•	Scalability: This solution can be extended to cover a larger volume of trades without requiring additional manpower, making it highly scalable across teams and regions.

Measures of success:

Success can be measured in three key ways:

	•	A reduction in review time from hours to minutes.
	•	Increased accuracy in detecting any breaches or inconsistencies.
	•	Scalability to process larger volumes of voice data as needed.

In summary, this solution streamlines a labor-intensive task, improves accuracy, and frees up analysts to focus on higher-value tasks. By using AWS Transcribe for transcription and NLP for analysis, we can enhance our assurance and surveillance processes in a scalable, efficient way.

Thank you for your time, and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.

This revised script should align well with your goals and fit the 3-4 minute timeframe, while clearly explaining the solution’s value and how it leverages AWS and NLP for automation.
