Subject: Request for Assistance with Filter Criteria for ESG Data Extraction

Dear Swati,

Happy New Year!

I hope this email finds you well. I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully established a connection to the UAT environment using the streaming API.

Could you kindly assist me with the relevant filter criteria required for extracting data, particularly the ESG-related columns for all equities products? I would appreciate it if you could share the details of the filter criteria you mentioned earlier, as I am unsure about the exact parameters that need to be passed in the body section outlined below.

Your guidance on this would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you require any additional information from my end.

Thank you in advance for your support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
