You can do this in Excel using a formula with TEXTJOIN, FILTER, and ISNUMBER+SEARCH.

Here’s how:

⸻

Assume:
	•	Column A: Impacted (comma-separated values like “ABC, XYZ, PQR”)
	•	Column B: Org (10 rows of values like “ABC”, “DEF”, etc.)
	•	You want to create a column C: Match Found — which lists the matching orgs from column B in each row of column A.

⸻

Step 1: Name the Org List (Optional but easier)
	1.	Select the 10 values in column B (let’s say B2:B11)
	2.	Go to Formulas > Define Name
	3.	Name it: OrgList

⸻

Step 2: Use this formula in C2:

=TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, FILTER(OrgList, ISNUMBER(SEARCH(OrgList, A2))))


⸻

What this does:
	•	SEARCH(OrgList, A2): looks for each org value inside the Impacted text.
	•	ISNUMBER(...): returns TRUE if a match is found.
	•	FILTER(...): filters only the matching orgs.
	•	TEXTJOIN(...): combines all matches into a comma-separated string.

⸻

Result:

If A2 = "ABC, XYZ, PQR" and OrgList has "ABC" and "PQR",
then C2 will show: "ABC, PQR"

Let me know if you’re using Excel 2016 or older — we can adjust it to work without FILTER.
