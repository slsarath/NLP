First and foremost, I apologize for the delay.

Please find attached a picture of myself.

I am a part of the CCO Data Science and Analytics I chose this workstream because I strongly believe in the importance of giving back to the community and creating a meaningful impact beyond our professional roles. Corporate citizenship represents an opportunity to contribute to causes that align with my personal values, such as sustainability, education, and community development.

This initiative resonates with me as it allows us to drive positive change while fostering a sense of purpose and collaboration within the organization. Being part of this workstream means actively participating in efforts that make a difference, both at an individual and collective level, and that is something Iâ€™m deeply passionate about.
