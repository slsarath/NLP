Let me know if you’d like help selecting the best ones to combine for a use case.



Got it! Based on your aim to build a generative AI solution for risk mitigation in banking using the approved public datasets, here’s a strong use case:

⸻

Use Case Title:
“Proactive Regulatory Risk Monitoring and Compliance Advisory using Generative AI”

⸻

Problem Statement:

Banks often struggle to stay ahead of regulatory changes, especially when these changes come from multiple jurisdictions (US SEC, UK FCA, OECD, etc.). Manual tracking of these updates is time-consuming and error-prone, increasing the risk of non-compliance and penalties.

⸻

Proposed Solution:

Build a generative AI-powered solution that automates the extraction, summarization, and risk-tagging of key regulatory updates across jurisdictions. The solution should:
	1.	Aggregate data from:
	•	SEC Filings (EDGAR) – for regulatory disclosures
	•	Federal Register & FCA – for regulatory publications
	•	OECD & Eurostat – for macroeconomic policy data
	2.	Use LLM/NLP to:
	•	Summarize long-form documents (filings, rules, policy updates)
	•	Identify high-risk areas by comparing updates with existing compliance controls
	•	Generate compliance advisories and impact summaries for internal teams
	3.	Provide Output via:
	•	A dashboard showing thematic risk areas and flagged alerts
	•	A generative Q&A assistant that lets users ask:
“What ESG-related regulatory changes occurred last month in UK?” or
“How does the latest SEC filing from XYZ Corp affect data privacy compliance?”

⸻

Target Outcome:
	•	Proactively identify emerging regulatory risks
	•	Reduce compliance overhead and late responses
	•	Enable risk-aware decision-making for control functions
